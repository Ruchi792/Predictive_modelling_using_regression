Objective
The aim of these projects is to demonstrate practical applications of predictive modelling techniques in business analytics, showcasing how data-driven decisions can be made using regression models.
My GitHub repository showcases a collection of predictive modelling projects.
These projects apply various regression techniques to real-world datasets to extract insights and build predictive models that solve practical business problems.
Projects Overview
Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates a different use case where predictive analytics is applied using linear, multiple, or logistic regression among other techniques

Key Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Model Evaluation Metrics (RÂ², RMSE, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
Visualization with Seaborn & Matplotlib
